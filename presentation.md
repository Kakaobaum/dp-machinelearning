# 🎮 Machine Learning App - WS8
```
Workshop 8: Deploy Python ML models with Streamlit 🥳
```

Welcome to the **Deploy Python ML Models with Streamlit** workshop! 🎉

In this hands-on session, you will learn how to create and deploy a machine learning model using Python and the powerful **Streamlit** framework. We will guide you step-by-step to build an interactive web app that predicts the species of penguins based on their physical characteristics. 

### What You’ll Learn:
1. **Building ML Models**: Understand the basics of training a RandomForestClassifier with Python.
2. **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Learn to create dynamic visualizations with Streamlit.
3. **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Build a clean and interactive interface to collect user input.
4. **Deploy Your App**: See how easy it is to share your ML model with the world using Streamlit.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Streamlit is the **fastest** and **easiest** way to build and share data apps directly in Python! 🐍✨ No front-end experience required. 🚀
